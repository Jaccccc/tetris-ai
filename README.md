# tetris-ai
An AI that learns to play tetris using NEAT python

Main tetris game from https://levelup.gitconnected.com/writing-tetris-in-python-2a16bddb5318

Neat documentation at https://neat-python.readthedocs.io/en/latest/index.html

This doesn't work that well, but it is a good demonstration of how to implement neat.
